As an engineer your job is to solve hard problems. Your colleagues in other departments also work on hard problems - a business has to solve complex challenges daily. But hard problems are the engineer's speciality. When the engineer's time is spent on hard problems, we consider that time well spent.

We sometimes forget what the difference is between solving hard problems and being busy. Some engineers think the best way to focus on hard problems is to avoid meetings. But when engineers only focus on the tasks in front of them, they eventually lose sight of their team's biggest challenges.

I once [heard this described](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilyLxczuHiY) as the difference between open and closed problems. We all have to "get shit done" from time to time. But if you're an engineer wondering how to make an impact at your company, try to frame your work in the context of the "open problems" that your business faces every day.
